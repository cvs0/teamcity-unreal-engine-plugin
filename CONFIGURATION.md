# Plugin Configuration

The plugin provides several configuration options that can adjust its internal behavior.
Server-side options are represented as TeamCity [internal properties][teamcity.internal-properties].
In most cases, you won't need to modify them.

## Internal Properties

### Distributed Build Event Bus

* `teamcity.internal.unreal-engine.distributed-build-event-bus.worker-buffer-size`

    Sets the buffer size for the internal queue of BuildGraph state-change events
    (used for UGS badge posting). When the buffer overflows, the oldest events are dropped.

    **Default value:** 100

### UGS Metadata Server

* `teamcity.internal.unreal-engine.ugs-metadata-server.retry-count`

    Defines the number of retry attempts the UGS client will make for failed requests before giving up.

    **Default value:** 3

* `teamcity.internal.unreal-engine.ugs-metadata-server.request-timeout`

    Specifies the timeout duration for an entire HTTP request to the UGS metadata server,
    from sending the request to receiving the response.
    The value should be formatted according to the ISO-8601 standard.

    **Default value:** PT5S (5 seconds)

## Debugging and Logging

When you need to debug the plugin, you'll need to create a dedicated logger in the corresponding TeamCity Log4j configuration files:

* Server: [TeamCity Server Logs - Changing Logging Settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/teamcity-server-logs.html#Changing+Logging+Settings)
* Agent: [Viewing Build Agent Logs - Log Files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/viewing-build-agent-logs.html#Log+Files)

The plugin produces logs with the specific prefix `jetbrains.buildServer.unrealEngine`. To debug the plugin, add the following configuration to the appropriate Log4j configuration file (depending on whether you want to debug the server or agent components):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<Configuration status="INFO">
  <!-- loggers -->
  <Loggers>
    <!-- ... existing loggers ... -->
    <Logger
        name="jetbrains.buildServer.unrealEngine"
        level="DEBUG"
        additivity="false">
      <AppenderRef ref="ROLL" />
    </Logger>
    <!-- ... existing loggers ... -->
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

This configuration will enable DEBUG-level logging for all plugin components, helping you troubleshoot issues and understand the plugin's behavior in detail. This might be particularly helpful when you create a ticket in YouTrack or on GitHub and need to attach detailed logs.
